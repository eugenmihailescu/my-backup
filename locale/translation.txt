If you want to add a new language translation or to update an existent translation you
should know that this is possible with the aid of PoEdit program (http://poedit.net/).

=============================
- How to add a new language -
=============================

1) Open the lang-codes.txt and add the language code coresponding to the language you
   want to add (eg. `de_DE.utf8,Deutsch`)
2) create a file called `default.po` in ./lang/<lang-code>/LC_MESSAGES/default.po
   You may use the ./lang/default.po sample file as a starting point.
3) Open that default.po file by using the PoEdit application
4) open the `Catalog -> Properties` menu and edit the translation properties and source 
   path
5) Open the `Catalog -> Update from sources` menu; it will scan the .php sources and will
   create a list with the default English strings (on the top) that you may translate one
   by one (on the bottom)
6) Start translating each string you select on the top list (Source text) at the bottom
   (the Translation). Read also the `Notes for translators`|`Comment` note (where available)
   because it just might help you to translate properly the piece of string you've just
   selected.
7) Once you`ve finished save the changes (the File -> Save menu). It will generate a .mo
   file at the default.po location. That is the machine readable object file that the 
   application will actually use. You may continue from the step 3) above at a later time.
8) To make sure the new translated text will be used make sure you restart your web server
   application (ie. restart the Apache/IIS/Nginx service).
   
NOTE: if you want to take advantage of the PoEdit automatic translation then open the
   `Edit -> Preferences` menu then choose the `Translation Memory` tab. Add a new language
   then press the `Generate database` button. It will scan your system for source|object
   files that might be used to create a ad-hoc language dictionary.

- How to update an existent language -
======================================

1) Go to our website and grab the .po source file:
	- http://wpmybackup.mynixworld.info/lang/<lang-code>.po

Ex: for the Swedish language the language code is sv_SE so you should download the file
http://wpmybackup.mynixworld.info/lang/sv_SE.po

2) open the PoEdit program then open the *.po file
3) follow the step 6) above
