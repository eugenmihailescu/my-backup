It allows you to create a full, differential or incremental backups of both files and your MySQL databases. Furthermore it secures the backup by uploading it to the local disk, Ftp(s), Scp, SFtp, Dropbox, Google Drive, Webdav or sent via SMTP within a single/multiple e-mail messages as attachments.\r\n\r\nThe backup may be stored uncompressed (as a TAR archive) or compressed as TAR/Zip archives using GZip/BZip/LZF respectively Zip compression. Nonetheless the archive may be encrypted on the fly with an AES (Rijndael) cipher using a 128/192/256 bit key such that its content is protected from the curious eyes (it will take billions years to crack a 256-bit key).\r\n\r\nIt allows you to restore with ease any backup created by itself or by some other application/plug-in both via an integrated Restore Wizard (PRO addon) and a built-in quick restore feature.  \r\n\r\nIn order to help you understand how it works and/or diagnose a particular issue it includes enhanced debugging functionalities.
